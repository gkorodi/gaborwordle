## Software Kraftsman Portfolio

View some of my JS/React FrontEnd experiments and learning opportunities. Since I am mostly a back-end and integration software engineer, I don't have much to showcase here, but once in a while I do like to go down memory lane.

## Website Structure

The website is at [gkorodi.github.io](https://gkorodi.github.io). Currently (2023-Nov-10) it only showcases some of the single-page-application examples that I have submitted for my homework, while taking a JS course.
